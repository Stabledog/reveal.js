# Les Matheson's Notes

9/22/18 - the Markdown smoke-test passed.  I installed node.js on the Mac and was able to do the [full setup](../reveal.js#full-setup) instructions to get presentations working with the browser.  Then, if you navigate to [the markdown hello-world page](./plugin/markdown/example.html), you find that it calls out to an [example.md](./plugin/markdown/example.md) with stuff that works in the browser as long as `npm start` is running in the `~/reveal.js/` directory.
